// Abstract gRPC server handler operation definitions. It is based on two
// operations allowing to describe every type of RPC: the HandlerOperation type
// which represents the RPC handler, and the ReceiveOperation type which
// represents the messages the RPC handler receives during its lifetime.
// This means that the ReceiveOperation(s) will happen within the
// HandlerOperation.
// Every type of RPC, unary, client streaming, server streaming, and
// bidirectional streaming RPCs, can be all represented with a HandlerOperation
// having one or several ReceiveOperation.
// The send operation is not required for now and therefore not defined, which
// means that server and bidirectional streaming RPCs currently have the same
// run-time representation as unary and client streaming RPCs.
